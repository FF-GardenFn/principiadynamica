# Circuit Tracer Integration Bridge

> **Status: Experimental Prototype**
>
> Integrating `constitutional-dynamics` with Anthropic's Circuit Tracer for advanced AI alignment monitoring and intervention.

## Overview

The Circuit Tracer Bridge module aims to connect the behavioral alignment monitoring capabilities of **`constitutional-dynamics`** (which leverages State Transition Calculus) with the mechanistic interpretability tools provided by **Anthropic's Circuit Tracer library**.

This integration seeks to create a powerful feedback loop, enabling:
1.  **Targeted Mechanistic Analysis:** Using `constitutional-dynamics` telemetry to trigger deep dives with Circuit Tracer when alignment issues or anomalous behaviors are detected.
2.  **Mechanistically-Informed Monitoring:** Enhancing `constitutional-dynamics` by incorporating insights from circuit analysis (e.g., tracking specific safety-critical features).
3.  **Advanced Interventions:** Designing interventions that can leverage circuit-level understanding to correct or steer model behavior more precisely.

The ultimate aim is an **"Alignment Thermostat"** â€“ a closed-loop system that continuously monitors, analyzes, and guides AI behavior towards robust alignment.

## Installation & Dependencies

This bridge is part of the `constitutional-dynamics` package. To use its features that interact with Anthropic's `circuit-tracer`, both libraries need to be installed:

1.  **Install Circuit Tracer:**
    Follow the installation instructions from the official repository:
    ```bash
    # Example: Clone their repository
    # git clone https://github.com/safety-research/circuit-tracer.git
    # cd circuit-tracer
    # pip install -e .
    ```
    *Please refer to the `safety-research/circuit-tracer` repository for the most up-to-date installation instructions.*

2.  **Install Constitutional Dynamics with `circuit_tracer` extra:**
    If installing `constitutional-dynamics` from source (from the `principiadynamica` repository root):
    ```bash
    pip install -e ".[circuit_tracer]"
    ```
    This ensures `torch` and other necessary dependencies for this integration are installed.

## Core Concept: The Alignment Thermostat

The central conceptual component prototyped here is the `AlignmentThermostat` class (found in `feedback_loop.py`). It's designed to orchestrate the feedback loop:

* **Monitors** model outputs using `constitutional-dynamics` metrics.
* (Future) Updates **stability metrics** (e.g., Lyapunov exponent estimates).
* Triggers **mechanistic analysis** (conceptually, via Circuit Tracer) when alignment issues are detected.
* Identifies potential **intervention targets** from this circuit analysis.
* Applies (currently simulated) **interventions** to the model, potentially modulated by system stability.
* Verifies if the intervention improved alignment.
* (Future) Consults the `MetaStrategist` for higher-level strategic recommendations.

### Stability-Modulated Activation (STC v0.2 Concept)

A key theoretical extension explored by `PrincipiaDynamica` for State Transition Calculus (STC v0.2) is the integration of a global stability metric directly into the micro-level activation probability ($\phi$) of state subsets. This aims to create the "Alignment Thermostat" that can pre-emptively adapt.

* **Current STC (in `constitutional-dynamics` v0.1.x):** Subset activation $\phi$ is primarily driven by factors like inherent subset weight `W'`, memory `M(t)`, and environment `E(t)`. Global stability is a post-hoc diagnostic.
* **Envisioned STC (v0.2+):** Subset activation $\phi$ will *also* be modulated by the system's own measured behavioral drift/stability (e.g., a Lyapunov-style estimate).

This allows the system to develop a built-in "alignment homeostasis," moving from traditional reactive interventions towards more predictive and auto-stabilizing oversight.

## Module Components

This `circuit_tracer_bridge` module currently includes:

* **`feedback_loop.py`:** Contains the `AlignmentThermostat` class shell, outlining the orchestration logic.
* **`interventions.py`:** Defines a base `CircuitTracerIntervention` class and example subclasses (e.g., `FeatureSuppressionIntervention`, `JailbreakMitigationIntervention`) demonstrating different types of mechanistically-informed interventions (currently with placeholder actions).
* **`monitors.py`:** Introduces `CircuitTracerMonitorAdapter` and specialized monitors (e.g., `JailbreakDetectionMonitor`, `DriftDetectionMonitor`) that enhance `constitutional-dynamics` monitoring to provide more targeted triggers and context for circuit analysis.
* **`examples/`:** Contains basic scripts (`drift_detection_demo.py`, `jailbreak_analysis_demo.py`) that demonstrate the conceptual workflow using mock components.

## Usage (Conceptual Example)

```python
from constitutional_dynamics.core.space import AlignmentVectorSpace
from constitutional_dynamics.integrations.circuit_tracer_bridge import AlignmentThermostat
# Assuming circuit_tracer library is installed and provides ReplacementModel
# from circuit_tracer import ReplacementModel # Or however it's imported

# 1. Initialize Constitutional Dynamics components
cd_monitor = AlignmentVectorSpace(dimension=768)
# ... define aligned region for cd_monitor ...

# 2. Initialize (mock or real) Circuit Tracer and Model Interface
# circuit_tracer_instance = ReplacementModel.from_pretrained(...) # Placeholder
# model_interface = YourActualModelInterface() # Placeholder

# For the demo, we use mock instances:
from .examples.common_mocks import MockAlignmentVectorSpace, MockCircuitTracer, MockModelInterface
cd_monitor_mock = MockAlignmentVectorSpace() 
circuit_tracer_mock = MockCircuitTracer()
model_interface_mock = MockModelInterface()


# 3. Create the Thermostat
thermostat = AlignmentThermostat(
    cd_monitor_instance=cd_monitor_mock,
    circuit_tracer_instance=circuit_tracer_mock, # This would be the actual tracer
    model_interface=model_interface_mock,        # Interface to apply interventions
    threshold=0.7,
    auto_stabilize=True 
)

# 4. In a processing loop for model outputs:
# current_embedding = get_model_output_embedding()
# original_prompt = get_original_prompt()
# result = thermostat.run_feedback_loop(current_embedding, original_prompt)
# if result.get("intervention_applied"):
#     print(f"Intervention result: Improved={result.get('improved')}, New Score={result.get('new_score')}")
```
(Note: The example above uses conceptual mock objects for brevity. See examples/ for runnable demos with more detailed mocks.)

## Development Status & Future Directions

This circuit_tracer_bridge is currently in a prototyping and conceptual design phase. Key future work includes:

* Implementing actual calls to the circuit-tracer library (replacing mocks).
* Developing more sophisticated logic for identify_intervention_targets based on graph analysis.
* Refining the apply_intervention methods to interact with a real model interface.
* Empirically testing the "Alignment Thermostat" feedback loop with live models.
* Further developing the STC mechanisms for stability-modulated activation.

Contributions and collaborations are welcome as this research progresses.
